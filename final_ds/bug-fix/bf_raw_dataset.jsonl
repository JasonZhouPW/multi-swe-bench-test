{"org": "dapr", "repo": "dapr", "number": 8518, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix Actor & Scheduler deadlocks and Integration Test fixes", "body": "This changes includes a number of changes to prevent dead locks in the actor runtime & Scheduler connectivity/job triggering sequences. There a number of disparate scenarios covered below. This change ensures that no deadlocks occur, particularly when running workflows, during scale (up or down) events, loosing connection or destruction of the placement and scheduler control plane services. Makes integration tests more stable, particularly in CI/slow machine runners.\r\n\r\nScenarios and fixes:\r\n\r\nAdds a new `scheduler` fields to the gRPC and HTTP metadata output, which includes an object containing the list of addresses which the daprd is currently connected to. This address list can change over time, as daprd dynamically connects/looses connection to scheduler hosts. Int tests added for this field, as well as being used to check the address list in some integration tests where the number of hosts connected is a dependency of that test scenario (e.g. job load balancing).\r\n\r\nMoves the placement lock to `dapr/kit/concurrency/lock` as a new shared `OuterCancel` lib. This struct was also fixed so that a deadlock could not occur on `RLock` whereby the given context was cancelled, but `RLock` did not return with error- now it does. This caused deadlocks in workflow actors whereby dissemination (deactivation) of actors would not complete as their was a circular lock which did not break.\r\n\r\nRemoves a deadlock in the Scheduler server whereby a new daprd stream was stuck adding to the connection pool. This was due to adding the new connections as deliverable prefixes, locks the underlying go-etcd-cron queue for those prefixes. If a job trigger was occurring at the same time, there was a circular lock with no break since the same Scheduler lock adding the new connection was RLocked to get the connection for that job trigger to send the job event to daprd. The use of the new `Context` lock from `dapr/concurrency/lock` ensures that getting the connection for a triggered job will fail the RLock if it does not gain the lock after 250ms. This breaks the circular lock. When this RLock fails, the job will be reported back to go-etcd-cron that the job is not deliverable and unlock the queue lock- since the job _is_ actually deliverable, go-etcd-cron will correctly re-enqueue the job immediately whilst releasing that queue lock in the mean time. See: https://github.com/diagridio/go-etcd-cron/blob/c9126ef694ffed83011125c5acbf6127f33bf784/internal/queue/queue.go#L209-L217\r\n\r\nFixes another deadlock in the Scheduler server whereby a connection to daprd would not correctly be identified as a closed or cancelled connection. This would happen when the connection is closed or cancelled, whilst there is a send & job handle in progress for a particular connection. This has been resolved by adding another go routine to the connection handler to detect when either Recv or Send has returned, the pool total is closed, or the stream context has closed, then closing and removing that connection entirely. This correctly ensures that the connection is removed from the pool, as well as returning from the stream at the top gRPC RPC level.\r\n\r\nPermanently backoff when calling a remote reminder when the remote peer is not available, i.e. during a scale down event. This prevents future retries, which slows down the entire placement dissemination for that namespace.\r\n\r\nMark the placement client as ready later- after the placement client has sent the first host request, so to better reflect the real ready state and prevent unnecessary timing errors which cause retries downstream.\r\n\r\nMove `HaltAll` and `Drain` implementation to the same func as they were the same implementation, only with one using a conditional for the drain.\r\n\r\nPre-fetch the actor sub Interfaces on the Factory initialization of workflow and activity actors. This prevents a circular deadlock during cases of dissemination where a workflow/activity actor would be deactivated whilst attempting to retrieve one of these interfaces (like state).\r\n\r\nMove the workflow actor internal lock to only be used in the _actual_ critical shared memory locations. Previous use of locking around actor resource usage like state would cause the same circular deadlock as described above.\r\n\r\nThe Scheudler client has been changed to be more aggressive for scheduler reconnects, particularly on `WatchHosts`. This prevents reconnect errors which were observed in scenarios whereby the entire scheduler cluster was to go down temporarily. Also removes the retry loop for the Scheduler client connector since a reconnect at the top level is preferred.\r\n\r\nMark the Scheduler client readiness to true only when all Scheduler host clients have actually sent the initial message to their respective host. Sets readiness to false during shutdown and reconnect events.\r\n\r\nJobsWatch passes a context up which will be closed when either Send/Recv or shutdown is in progress to ensure the gRPC API is returned on disconnect events.\r\n\r\nSet Scheduler log level to `debug` in e2e CI runs.\r\n\r\nWe need to register our custom proxy codec in the global registrar, but only after all gRPC internal codecs have been registered. This is because we are squatting the conflicted base name \"proto\" which we use to inject our custom marshal code. We do this to optionally passthrough proxy data if the gRPC frame encoding is a message we don't recognise- i.e. a user is doing a direct message using their own message type. Since 'd' comes before 'g' in the alphabet and go `init` func execution order is now sane, we have to register our conflicting base codec as runtime. It is also the case that gRPC uses a global variable codec registrar so we can't build a custom one that we propagate. The solution is to keep this as is, or find a way to bypass the codec stack further down the transport layer in a wrapper. I assume we can use a custom message type to wrap user messages which does not have a conflicting name with the base codec.\r\n\r\nDon't register actor types to Scheduler if the SchedulerActorReminders preview feature is disabled.\r\n\r\nDon't lock the table on calls to Actor Type list.\r\n\r\nEnsure that shutdown or fatal placement connection errors do not gracefully drain active actors on the host, and instead deactivate them immediately. Refactor actors table to de-dupe logic and reduce string concat.\r\n\r\nAdd backoff retry to legacy reminder state store `getRemindersForActorType` to account for etag missmatch.\r\n\r\nIntegration Tests:\r\n\r\n- Set all exec processes to use `debug` log level to make debugging easier when Integration tests fail.\r\n- Fixes shutdown timeout of HTTP app Cleanup.\r\n- Fix log line process Cleanup logic to ensure all exec process logs are flushed before checking for a log line existence.\r\n- Fixes timing errors in scheduler failure policy tests.\r\n-  Adds actor type handler not implementing the deactivation endpoints.\r\n-  Reduce the number of components in fuzz component name tests to prevent shutdown timeouts on slow CI runnners.\r\n- Fix broken pipe network errors which occur on slow CI runners.\r\n- Adds tests for the new scheduler metadata field, both for gRPC and HTTP.\r\n- Fix state metrics tests by using the correct Enventually tester on asserts.\r\n- Correctly use Workflow `WaitForSingleEvent` for workflow coordination, rather than cross scope channels for singling.\r\n- Use eventuallys to prevent EOF errors during placement dissemination tests.\r\n- Prevent cleanup timeout on reminder remote tests using non-closing channels for signaling.\r\n- Prevent exec panic on pipe output close timeouts.\r\n- Prevent exec error panicing whole suite & include timeout before closing exec std pipes.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dapr/dapr/pulls/8518", "id": 2354503956, "node_id": "PR_kwDOC3tUwM6MVuEU", "html_url": "https://github.com/dapr/dapr/pull/8518",

fixes\n\nThis changes includes a number of changes to prevent dead locks in the\nactor runtime & Scheduler connectivity/job triggering sequences. There a\nnumber of disparate scenarios covered below. This change ensures that no\ndeadlocks occur, particularly when running workflows, during scale (up\nor down) events, loosing connection or destruction of the placement\nand scheduler control plane services. Makes integration tests more\nstable, particularly in CI/slow machine runners.\n\nScenarios and fixes:\n\nAdds a new `scheduler` fields to the gRPC and HTTP metadata output,\nwhich includes an object containing the list of addresses which the\ndaprd is currently connected to. This address list can change over time,\nas daprd dynamically connects/looses connection to scheduler hosts. Int\ntests added for this field, as well as being used to check the address\nlist in some integration tests where the number of hosts connected is a\ndependency of that test scenario (e.g. job load balancing).\n\nMoves the placement lock to `dapr/kit/concurrency/lock` as a new shared\n`OuterCancel` lib. This struct was also fixed so that a deadlock could\nnot occur on `RLock` whereby the given context was cancelled, but\n`RLock` did not return with error- now it does. This caused deadlocks in\nworkflow actors whereby dissemination (deactivation) of actors would\nnot complete as their was a circular lock which did not break.\n\nRemoves a deadlock in the Scheduler server whereby a new daprd stream\nwas stuck adding to the connection pool. This was due to adding the new\nconnections as deliverable prefixes, locks the underlying go-etcd-cron\nqueue for those prefixes. If a job trigger was occurring at the same\ntime, there was a circular lock with no break since the same Scheduler\nlock adding the new connection was RLocked to get the connection for\nthat job trigger to send the job event to daprd. The use of the new\n`Context` lock from `dapr/concurrency/lock` ensures that getting the\nconnection for a triggered job will fail the RLock if it does not gain\nthe lock after 250ms. This breaks the circular lock. When this RLock\nfails, the job will be reported back to go-etcd-cron that the job is not\ndeliverable and unlock the queue lock- since the job _is_ actually\ndeliverable, go-etcd-cron will correctly re-enqueue the job immediately\nwhilst releasing that queue lock in the mean time. See:\nhttps://github.com/diagridio/go-etcd-cron/blob/c9126ef694ffed83011125c5acbf6127f33bf784/internal/queue/queue.go#L209-L217\n\nFixes another deadlock in the Scheduler server whereby a connection to\ndaprd would not correctly be identified as a closed or cancelled\nconnection. This would happen when the connection is closed or\ncancelled, whilst there is a send & job handle in progress for a\nparticular connection. This has been resolved by adding another go\nroutine to the connection handler to detect when either Recv or Send has\nreturned, the pool total is closed, or the stream context has closed,\nthen closing and removing that connection entirely. This correctly\nensures that the connection is removed from the pool, as well as\nreturning from the stream at the top gRPC RPC level.\n\nPermanently backoff when calling a remote reminder when the remote peer\nis not available, i.e. during a scale down event. This prevents future\nretries, which slows down the entire placement dissemination for that\nnamespace.\n\nMark the placement client as ready later- after the placement client\nhas sent the first host request, so to better reflect the real ready\nstate and prevent unnecessary timing errors which cause retries\ndownstream.\n\nMove `HaltAll` and `Drain` implementation to the same func as they were\nthe same implementation, only with one using a conditional for the\ndrain.\n\nPre-fetch the actor sub Interfaces on the Factory initialization of\nworkflow and activity actors. This prevents a circular deadlock during\ncases of dissemination where a workflow/activity actor would be\ndeactivated whilst attempting to retrieve one of these interfaces (like\nstate).\n\nMove the workflow actor internal lock to only be used in the _actual_\ncritical shared memory locations. Previous use of locking around actor\nresource usage like state would cause the same circular deadlock as\ndescribed above.\n\nThe Scheudler client has been changed to be more aggressive for\nscheduler reconnects, particularly on `WatchHosts`. This prevents\nreconnect errors which were observed in scenarios whereby the entire\nscheduler cluster was to go down temporarily. Also removes the retry\nloop for the Scheduler client connector since a reconnect at the top\nlevel is preferred.\n\nMark the Scheduler client readiness to true only when all Scheduler\nhost clients have actually sent the initial message to their respective\nhost. Sets readiness to false during shutdown and reconnect events.\n\nJobsWatch passes a context up which will be closed when either\nSend/Recv or shutdown is in progress to ensure the gRPC API is returned\non disconnect events.\n\nSet Scheduler log level to `debug` in e2e CI runs.\n\nIntegration Tests:\n\nSet all exec processes to use `debug` log level to make debugging easier\nwhen Integration tests fail.\n\nFixes shutdown timeout of HTTP app Cleanup.\nFix log line process Cleanup logic to ensure all exec process logs are\nflushed before checking for a log line existence.\nFixes timing errors in scheduler failure policy tests.\nAdds actor type handler not implementing the deactivation endpoints.\nReduce the number of components in fuzz component name tests to prevent\nshutdown timeouts on slow CI runnners.\nFix broken pipe network errors which occur on slow CI runners.\nAdds tests for the new scheduler metadata field, both for gRPC and HTTP.\nFix state metrics tests by using the correct Enventually tester on\nasserts.\nCorrectly use Workflow `WaitForSingleEvent` for workflow coordination,\nrather than cross scope channels for singling.\nUse eventuallys to prevent EOF errors during placement dissemination\ntests.\n\nSigned-off-by: joshvanl <me@joshvanl.dev>"}, {"sha": "0c42d2243de67adf3e448c9dda3497f7d070c2f3", "parents":

This is because we are squatting the conflicted base name \"proto\" which we use to inject our custom marshal code. We do this to optionally passthrough proxy data if the gRPC frame encoding is a message we don't recognise- i.e. a user is doing a direct message using their own message type. Since 'd' comes before 'g' in the alphabet and go `init` func execution order is now sane, we have to register our conflicting base codec as runtime. It is also the case that gRPC uses a global variable codec registrar so we can't build a custom one that we propagate. The solution is to keep this as is, or find a way to bypass the codec stack further down the transport layer in a wrapper. I assume we can use a custom message type to wrap user messages which does not have a conflicting name with the base codec.\r\n\r\nDon't register actor types to Scheduler if the SchedulerActorReminders preview feature is disabled.\r\n\r\nDon't lock the table on calls to Actor Type list.\r\n\r\nEnsure that shutdown or fatal placement connection errors do not gracefully drain active actors on the host, and instead deactivate them immediately. Refactor actors table to de-dupe logic and reduce string concat.\r\n\r\nAdd backoff retry to legacy reminder state store `getRemindersForActorType` to account for etag missmatch.\r\n\r\nIntegration Tests:\r\n\r\n- Set all exec processes to use `debug` log level to make debugging easier when Integration tests fail.\r\n- Fixes shutdown timeout of HTTP app Cleanup.\r\n- Fix log line process Cleanup logic to ensure all exec process logs are flushed before checking for a log line existence.\r\n- Fixes timing errors in scheduler failure policy tests.\r\n-  Adds actor type handler not implementing the deactivation endpoints.\r\n-  Reduce the number of components in fuzz component name tests to prevent shutdown timeouts on slow CI runnners.\r\n- Fix broken pipe network errors which occur on slow CI runners.\r\n- Adds tests for the new scheduler metadata field, both for gRPC and HTTP.\r\n- Fix state metrics tests by using the correct Enventually tester on asserts.\r\n- Correctly use Workflow `WaitForSingleEvent` for workflow coordination, rather than cross scope channels for singling.\r\n- Use eventuallys to prevent EOF errors during placement dissemination tests.\r\n- Prevent cleanup timeout on reminder remote tests using non-closing channels for signaling.\r\n- Prevent exec panic on pipe output close timeouts.\r\n- Prevent exec error panicing whole suite & include timeout before closing exec std pipes."}], "fix_patch": "diff --git a/Makefile b/Makefile\nindex 8e691a85b31..31eb1344baa 100644\n--- a/Makefile\n+++ b/Makefile\n@@ -296,6 +296,7 @@ docker-deploy-k8s:

This can happen when an app becomes unresponsive and stops consuming messages from the stream, overflowing its buffer and resulting in a stuck. stream send operation on the placement service side.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes:\r\n- Refactors the leadership change code for clarity, adding two new metrics: `dapr_placement_leader_status` and `dapr_placement_raft_leader_status`.\r\n- It introduces a small refactor in the init code, bringing it closer to what we have in the scheduler service.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Issue reference\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/7031\r\n-

If it has been synced at least once for the targetRevision and it is still OutOfSync, move it to Progressing and wait for a manual/magical intervention. User can/should configure sync retry on their applications.\r\n- When an application can reconcile, but has invalid conditions, set it to progressing until a manual intervention happen.\r\n- When an application cannot reconcile, usually it is because of an InvalidSpec/project/namespace configuration, then it is not considered as a valid app and it is left in pending until the errors are resolved and can reconcile.\r\n- Remove the documented feature that application are move automatically to Healthy becasue the code does not exist for that.\r\n- Sort ApplicationStatus by application name so it is consistent\r\n- Add info logs for all progressive sync transitions\r\n"}], "fix_patch": "diff --git a/applicationset/controllers/applicationset_controller.go

The feature only interacts with the health of managed Applications. It is not intended to support direct integrations with other Rollout controllers (such as the native ReplicaSet controller or Argo Rollouts).\n \n-* Progressive Syncs watch for the managed Application resources to become \"Healthy\" before proceeding to the next stage.\n-* Deployments, DaemonSets, StatefulSets, and [Argo Rollouts](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/) are all supported, because the Application enters a \"Progressing\" state while pods are being rolled out. In fact, any resource with a health check that can report a \"Progressing\" status is supported.\n-* [Argo CD Resource Hooks](../../user-guide/resource_hooks.md) are supported. We recommend this approach for users that need advanced functionality when an Argo Rollout cannot be used, such as smoke testing after a DaemonSet change.\n+- Progressive Syncs watch for the managed Application resources to become \"Healthy\" before proceeding to the next stage.\n+- Deployments, DaemonSets, StatefulSets, and [Argo Rollouts](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/) are all supported, because the Application enters a \"Progressing\" state while pods are being rolled out.

Before it returned the type as a string (e.g. `\"type\": \"FILE_INFO_TYPE_DIRECTORY\"`). The latter is still documented and I suspect the change is unintended. As there was refactoring done it probably is a side-effect of that.\r\n\r\nI suppose the old behavior should be restored or the documentation should be updated.\r\n\r\n(Note that I don't care about the way the type is returned. I only stumbled across this as it broke the file browser in Syncthing Tray. If integers are more convenient to work with then I'm fine with that.
