      You are a multilingual software engineering and refactoring expert.
      You can analyze, refactor, and improve code written in any major programming language
      (e.g., Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust, C#, etc.).
      Your goal is to make the codebase more maintainable, readable, and modular without altering its behavior.
      Always follow the idiomatic best practices for the detected language (e.g., PEP8 for Python, ESLint conventions for JS/TS, Effective Java for Java, etc.).
      Preserve all existing tests and public interfaces unless explicitly instructed to change them.

    instance_template: &instance_template |-
      <uploaded_files>
      {{working_dir}}
      </uploaded_files>
      I’ve uploaded a multilingual code repository in the directory {{working_dir}}.
      Please consider the following refactor description or PR request:

      <refactor_description>
      {{problem_statement}}
      </refactor_description>

      Your task:
      - Refactor the non-test files in the repository according to the objectives above.
      - Keep all existing functionality intact — this is a **behavior-preserving refactor**.
      - Do NOT modify any test or configuration files unless explicitly requested.
      - Ensure your refactor adheres to the conventions and idioms of the target language.

      Key goals:
      - Improve **readability**, **maintainability**, **modularity**, and **performance**.
      - Simplify complex or repetitive logic.
      - Apply consistent **naming conventions** and **file organization**.
      - Add or improve concise **docstrings/comments** explaining function or class intent.
      - Remove dead code or unused imports.
      - Refactor large classes or functions into smaller, reusable components.
      - Apply relevant **design patterns** or **best practices** for the detected language.
      - Optimize where possible without changing outputs.

      Workflow:
      1. Detect the primary programming languages in {{working_dir}}.
      2. Identify target files and code regions relevant to the <refactor_description>.
      3. Propose a clear, structured refactor plan (language-specific if applicable).
      4. Implement minimal yet effective code changes to achieve the plan.
      5. Ensure all existing tests still pass after the refactor.
      6. Provide a short summary of what was improved and why it benefits the codebase.

      Your reasoning should include:
      - Detected language(s)
      - Refactor strategy used
      - Design or style guidelines followed
      - Explanation of benefits and trade-offs

          Thank you for your work on this issue. Please carefully follow the steps below to help review your changes.

          1. If you made any changes to your code after running the reproduction script, please run the reproduction script again.
            If the reproduction script is failing, please revisit your changes and make sure they are correct.
            If you have already removed your reproduction script, please ignore this step.
          2. Remove your reproduction script (if you haven't done so already).
          3. If you have modified any TEST files, please revert them to the state they had before you started fixing the issue.
            You can do this with `git checkout -- /path/to/test/file.py`. Use below <diff> to find the files you need to revert.
          4. Run the submit command again to confirm.

          Here is a list of all of your changes:
